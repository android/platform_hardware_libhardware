      "message": "I am not sure why the boot control HAL requires libhardware. Are you sure it requires all the dependencies of libhardware ? If that is not the case I would advise to create a library libhardware_boot that only pull the dependencies needed by the recovery partition. The executables are going to be duplicated anyway, right ?\nLibhardware is some legacy code and I am not sure I want it to propagate more than necessary.",
