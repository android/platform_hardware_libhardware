      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should limit the size of the gravity vector to 1g -- it would be kind of cool if this stuff worked on the moon too.\n\nLet\u0027s just say that the gravity sensor indicates the direction and magnitude of gravity. The value is 9.8 m/s^2 on earth.\n\nNote: the value returned by this sensor is different from the value returned from the accelerometer. ie: when the device is flat on a table, the value is \u003c 0, 0, -9.81 \u003e (as opposed to \u003c 0, 0, +9.81 \u003e from the accelerometer).\nQuestion: is that desirable?",

I understand that it prevents people from implementing the new orientation sensor until we release our internal changes, but there is no way around it.",
